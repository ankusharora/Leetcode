<span style="color: red"> How would you handle webpage hit count for a webpage that has multiple concurrent hits? </span>



<span style="color: green"> Distrubuted Systems </span>

If the webpage is served by multiple application instances or servers, a centralized solution is necessary.

    a. Using a Database - 
    Maintain a hit count table in the database. For example:

    hit_counter table with columns: page_id, hit_count.
    Use a transaction or UPDATE query to increment the count:


    UPDATE hit_counter SET hit_count = hit_count + 1 WHERE page_id = ?;

Ensure database connection pooling and proper indexing for performance.


<span style="color: green"> Basic Approaches </span>
    
    a. Using a synchronized counter
    
    Use a shared counter (e.g., AtomicInteger or AtomicLong in Java) to keep track of hits.
    
    This approach is suitable for single-instance applications where all hits are managed within the same process.


<span style="color: green">Using a Cache (e.g., Redis)</span>

    Use an in-memory data store like Redis for high-performance hit counting.

    Redis has built-in atomic increment operations (INCR).
